Briefly explain the work that you did on this project: What code were you given? What code did you create yourself?

I was responsible for the creation of the Q-training algorithm. It utilized a deep Q-learning algorithm to solve pathfinding problems. 


Connect your learning from throughout this course to the larger field of computer science:

Computer Scientists design, develop, and optimize software systems to solve complex problems across different industries. They design algorithms, manage data, and develop programs that automate tasks, analyze data, and enhance human capabilities. This is essential because almost every sector today—healthcare, finance, retail, and more—depends on technology to run smoothly. By working on innovations like AI, cloud computing, and cybersecurity, computer scientists drive progress, boost productivity, and make vital information more accessible, often leading to solutions that can improve and even save lives.

Approaching a problem as a computer scientist involves a structured and methodical process. First, the problem is clearly defined by understanding the requirements, inputs, outputs, and potential challenges. Next, existing solutions and technologies are researched to gather insights and identify useful data patterns. After that, an efficient algorithm is designed, often by breaking the problem into smaller, manageable parts. The solution is then implemented by writing clean, efficient code and integrating software components. Testing and debugging follow to ensure the solution handles all scenarios and works as intended. Finally, the solution is refined and optimized, incorporating feedback to improve performance, accuracy, or user experience. This systematic approach enables computer scientists to address complex problems effectively, building solutions that are robust, scalable, and reliable.

Ethical responsibilities are a key part of a computer scientist's role. This includes ensuring privacy and data security by building systems that protect user information from unauthorized access, misuse, and breaches. Computer scientists should use encryption, anonymization, and other measures to safeguard sensitive data. Transparency is also crucial, especially with AI systems; users should understand how these systems work and the logic behind their recommendations. Addressing bias and ensuring fairness in algorithms is essential to prevent discrimination and promote equitable solutions. While aligning with an organization’s goals, computer scientists must prioritize user trust and ethical practices. Ultimately, their role is not just about coding but about creating systems that enhance life while upholding high standards of ethics, privacy, and security. By applying these principles, I aim to contribute to building responsible and innovative technology.
